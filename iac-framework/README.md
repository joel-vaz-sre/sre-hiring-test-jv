# Summary

Terraform code for provisioning cloud space for the Aircall image resizer application.

# Todo

- Implement terraform modules for multiple reused resources (Example S3 bucket);
- Test terraform code;
- Implement variables.tf and locals.tf for cleaner code;
- Create terraform code for IAM user/roles (github iam role and joel-vaz-sre user) and users in order to guarantee that the cloud space is fully iac.
